## 📌 About The Project

HyperPay Analytics is a production-grade Payment Intelligence Dashboard built with React.js, inspired by Juspay's HyperCheckout payment infrastructure. This project simulates a real-world payment monitoring platform where businesses can track transactions, analyze payment trends, and monitor key performance indicators in real time.

The dashboard handles 40+ mock transactions across multiple payment methods including UPI, Card, NetBanking, Wallet, and BNPL — giving a complete picture of payment health at a glance.
